# about this file
This file contains multiple sections that detail my data management; documentation and metadata, which describes how others can understand, located and intrepret my data, as well as applicable formats; organization and storage, which describs my naming conventions, security and intellectual property; sharing, publication and archiving, which will detail access and potential restrictions; and accessibility, which will detail my plan to ensure my formats are available for users with disabilities. This format is based on the [UO library research guide on data management](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management) and UO's [Basic Accessibility Testing guidance](https://digitalaccessibility.uoregon.edu/assessment/basictesting).

# expected data and formats
For my file formats, I plan to use markdown (.md) on github as well as backup plain text (.txt) files stored locally for primary text files. For any images or video files that should occur within my research, I plan to use JPEG (.jpg), and MPEG-4 High Profile (.mp4). AduoAnd for my project proposal, a markdown file on github. For large data and mass storage, large files will be grouped under zip (.zip). Interviews will be recorded in MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (.mp3), and transcribed in markdown and plain text. 

# documentation and metadata
I will document my data in markdown, as well as on the cloud with google docs. My gathered data comes in limited formats: text and video in particular, and my writing of annotations will be available on Github, unless otherwise noted. My prototype proposal will be located under prototype.md, and my future proposal article will be located on a seperate Github repository, zwhitley11/vgemulationuo. Github will be procedurally updated throughout the week (as scheduled) to accomodate these annotations. After I have found methods of storage for individual pieces of data, I plan to use a complex Excel sheet to catalog my research. Within this catalog, I will store my metadata. My metadata will be keyword-based, labeling each article with tags, as well as descriptions. They will be numbered in the standard date format listed below.

# organization and storage
My initial project storage on will be github servers via this repository and the vgemulationuo repository. The backup will be on a linked google drive via .zip files. Any file organization and updating will take place through weekend updates. Any local computer organization also takes place on the same day. Every 6 months, the project will be uploaded to the Scholar's Bank digital repository of UO. 

- File naming convention will go as follows: eng470-YYYYMMDD-description.format. 

# sharing, publication, and archiving
To provide others access to my data, I will be posting markdown files on this github repository, as well as the vgemulationuo repository which will detail my data through my research. This will be new annotations, interesting thoughts, and updates. Though I do have a catalog document, I plan on keeping that information restricted to myself and collaborators. I do not anticipate many changes to my data, but I plan on keeping it alive through Scholar's Bank, as well as cloud and local backups. If something were to happen to github, I would create a new page for the data to be displayed.

# accessibility
To ensure my data and project outputs are accessible for users with disabilities, I plan to: include alternative text for any images, transcripts for videos, section headings for readability, high contrast colors for presented visual aids, as well as describing the point and purpose of each hyperlink. Should any additional accomodations be needed, users can contact me personally at zwhitley@uoregon.edu for any requests.
