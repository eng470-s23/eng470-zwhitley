# What's a White Paper?

In digital humanities, it is common for project teams to publish a report of funded development activities after a grant cycle is completed. The following template is taken from the [instructions provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/how-write-successful-white-paper-tips-odh) to recipients of Digital Humanities Advancement Grants.

Not a bad idea to include a table of contents here with relative links to your section headers.

## Project Summary/Abstract (1 paragraph) 

When people think emulators, they think retro games and pirated software. However, this paints a misconstrued picture of the uses and purposes of emulators â€“ from emulating current games to make use of the unique properties and tools, to preserving games, and to help gamers who may be physically disabled play games previously inaccessible (due to control schemes, older hardware, and many other reasons). The problem is, no one is talking about emulation for these purposes. Scholarly research in this topic is already limited, and most video game studies research has primarily has focused on the usage of emulators for preservations purposes, and not for the reasons of usage as a medium to help provide accesibility. This project, through literary review and popular media analysis aims to start a conversation at the University of Oregon with the goal to begin talk and work to fill this research gap. 

## Project Origins and Goals

This project began from a passion for retro games and wanting to bring them to my school campus. Through the course of my research, it has developed and taken on an additional goal: filling a research gap in the use of emulators as an accessible (in terms of physical disabilities) alternative to inaccessible hardware. 

My project is ultimately intended for digital game studies minors, for the purposes of enhancing studies, and providing accessible methods of video game emulation that fits a variety of skills, physical abilities and hardware. Within the project, I plan to write a proposal for the UO administration on the basis of adopting emulation for the purposes of video games study, retro game preservation, and starting a new conversation on the usages of emulation for disability studies. The proposal itself is intended for the UO administration, but a digital copy will be available online. 

## Project Activities, Team, and Participants

This project began on April ___ the beginning of Spring term at the University of Oregon, with 10 weeks of research conduction. 

This project has been conducted solely by myself, with guidance from my professor, Dr. Mattie Burkert and review from my peers in our ENG-470 class. 

## Project Outcomes

In terms of outcomes, if this project were to be adopted, the digital games studies program would benefit greatly from being able to study games through emulators. I plan on reaching this audience by my administration project proposal, and which would make a substantive change to the program.

## Project Continuation and Long-Term Impact

For the future, and after I create the proposal, I plan to "leave the door open" so to speak, and let anyone who would like to continue my project pick up the pieces. This is a topic that needs to keep being talked about.

# Appendix 1: Bibliography

This is where you can revise, update, and augment your annotated bib. Regardless of whether you keep the annotations, you should include a full bibliography of your sources.
