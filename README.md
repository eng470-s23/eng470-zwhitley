## Project-level Basic Information - Introduction 

1. Project Name: How to Explore Video Games through Emulators: A Proposal for Digital Game Study
2. Dataset file name(s) and extension(s): File naming convention will go as follows: eng470-YYYYMMDD-description.format. For my file formats, I plan to use markdown (.md) on github as well as backup plain text .txt files. For any images or video files, I plan to use JPEG (.jpg), and MPEG-4 High Profile (.mp4). And for my project proposal, a pdf. For large data and mass storage, large files will be grouped under zip (.zip).
3. Project description/abstract/keywords: This project focuses on starting a conversation about video game emulation through a proposal written for the University of Oregon. Read my abstract [here](https://github.com/eng470-s23/eng470-zwhitley/blob/main/white-paper.md#project-summaryabstract-1-paragraph)

## Methodological and Data-specific Information
1. Description of methods for data collection and processing: I compiled my texts for literary analysis through UO LibrarySearch and Google Scholar, tuning the search to focus on UO + Summit + Articles, with my topic in mind. I processed these texts through literary analysis and annotation.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

Land Acknowledgement: The technology used to produce this project and video games as a whole have been made using harmful fossil fuels, as well as exploitative labor practices. I do not condone these practices, and encourage safer labor practices and green alternatives whenever available. 

This project was produced at The University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. The University of Oregon sits on Kalapuya Ilihi, the homeland of the Kalapuya people, who were forcibly removed from 1851 and 1855.

I'd like to personally thank my professor for guidance on this project, and those who have supported me along the way.
