## annotated bibliography
*Each annotation should include:*
- *a full citation in Chicago, MLA, APA, or AP style (or another style appropriate to your discipline, with approval)*
- *a 4-5 sentence annotation summarizing the main ideas and content of the piece and discussing how you plan to use it for your project.*

### source 1 annotation
- citation: Newman, James. “Saving (and Re-Saving) Videogames: Rethinking Emulation for Preservation, Exhibition and Interpretation.” International Journal of Creative Media Research 1.1 (2019): n. pag. Web.
- summary: In this article for The International Journal of Creative Media Research, Newman argues against the “fetishization” of audiovisual accuracy in video game emulation. In its place, Newman focuses on the “transformative nature of emulation” – such as the unique tools that are offered when played through an emulator like the “savestate.” Taking in these new considerations, games can preserved to keep the original state in mind, as well as embracing features which allow for opportunities away from the original game experience. 
- potential use for project: highlighting the importance use of emulation.

Technology Law Journal, vol. 16, no. 1, 2001, pp. 33-52. HeinOnline. 

- summary: In this 1999-2000 case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Connectix, Inc., was sued by Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc for the development of a Playstation emulator, “Virtual Game Station.” None of Sony’s computer code was within the emulator, but the process was reverse engineered. In the district decision, the court prohibited the marketing of the VGS and rejected the defense of “fair use.” However, on appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court determined that it did in fact constitute fair use. Disassembly for the purposes of reverse engineering is legal, and Sony’s original code and BIOS program contained too many aspects that could not be considered copyrightable. The code being entirely new was consistent with “transformative in nature” copyright laws. While the Playstation and VGS can play the same games, the VGS is a “wholly new product.”
- potential use for project: emulators are a very complex and legal grey area, and this helps explain why.

Copyrighted World." Suffolk University Law Review, vol. 36, no. 3, 2003, pp. 843-862.
HeinOnline. 
- summary: This 2003 article from Suffolk University Law Review by Jeffrey S. Libby sets and tells the history of emulation, and pushes readers towards emulation archiving – especially with the possibility of nothing being left in less than fifty years. Video game EPROMs, batteries, SRAM’s and circuit boards will be physically beyond repair for the original hardware, with the potential for some games to go extinct. This article recaps history, from early computer creation, to Sony v. Connectix. Additionally, current legal implications and ramifications going forward, such as tarnishment actions against the emulation industry, should customers associate poor performance with the original console, and not the emulated software. This also raises questions about ROM’s, which are the encoded games playable on emulators. If the ROM’s are not uploaded from the game itself, it is considered copyright infringement. 
- potential use for project: This article is 20 years old, but still highlights an important problem that has yet to be solved; video game life expectancy. These conversations were happening two decades ago, but nothing substantive has been done to push for legal and accessible preservation.

### source 4 annotation
- citation: Guins, Raiford. Game after : a Cultural Study of Video Game Afterlife. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2014. Print.
- summary: This book written by Raiford Guin, begins by providing an examination of museum and library collections of video games as a way to follow the progression of the industry over time. Guin evaluates the life-cycle of a video game including what happens after a game becomes obsolete. The book continues by looking at case studies of particular games once they were out of date, what happened to them in terms of collections, and why they were –or were not– memorialized. 
- potential use for project: goes into detail on current practices of preservation, not just emulation, and explores collections of games in different spaces. 

### source 5 annotation
- citation: Lowood, Henry, and Raiford Guins. Debugging Game History : a Critical Lexicon. Ed. Henry Lowood and Raiford Guins. Cambridge, Massachusetts ;: The MIT Press, 2016. Print.
- summary: This collection of essays was curated by many researchers across academic fields that relate to game studies, primarily focusing on critical historical studies. Individuals from game design to etymology share thoughts on different aspects of history. One of these essays by Jon Ippolito looks at follows the history of emulation alongside the rise, fall, and resurgence of the game industry. Another essay, by Jas Purewal, defines many terms about intellectual property used in reference to video games. 
- potential use for project: the essay collection offers lots of information about emulation history and video game history as a whole

- citation: Winget, Megan A. "Videogame preservation and massively multiplayer online role‐playing games: A review of the literature." Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 62.10 (2011): 1869-1883.
- summary: Megan Winget examines the complications with preservation of online multiplayer video games in this article. The article reviews the technological difficulties of game preservation such as mods as an added complication. Winget also raises the concern of how rapidly unavailable video games can become in concern of capturing and preserving. The importance of highlighting games as social artifacts when preserving them. 
- potential use for project: raises concerns technological difficulties and reminds the importance of social/ cultural preservation alongside physical

## environmental scan
*The environmental scan situates your project within the existing scholarly research and articulates its contribution. Answer each of the following questions in about one well-developed paragraph. You may use bulleted lists to organize your thoughts, but please write in complete sentences.*

### contribution
*Describe what you will do and why. What is unique about your project and what you will be contributing to your scholarly community? What problem will be resolved, what question will be answered, or what opportunity will be created through your project?*

- I would like to put together a project proposal for the University of Oregon administration. This project would encompass digital game studies and media studies, with a focus on video game emulation. The purpose of the project is to put together a plan for setting up video game emulation on campus for research and preservation purposes. My goal is to provide detailed methods for 5-10 separate types of video game consoles, with room for expansion. 

- This would help resolve the ongoing problem of retro video games becoming increasingly hard to study, as the hardware physically decays over time, with no feasible alternative. My project would advocate for the setup of a digital video game archive, digital video game emulator(s), and more. This contributes to the ongoing scholarly conversation regarding video game preservation and emulation, as well as pushing to help solve the legal gray area. 

- While I will be graduating, I hope to leave this project proposal for someone else to pick up and continue. 

### methods
*What tools and methods will you use, and why are those the best technologies for your purposes?*

- With my tools and methods, I anticipate making use of the research I have collected digitally, as well as physical books I have checked out. As for my project proposal, I will write it on github. For developing and choosing the emulators I plan to highlight, I want to evaluate them on specific criteria. The total catalog of platforms on an emulator, reproducibility, accessible controller inputs, and legality. 

### stakeholders / audiences
*For whom is your project intended: academics, members of the public, your institution, etc.? Who is invested in the final products? How can you reach that audience and meet the needs of interested parties and stakeholders?*

- My project (should it be fulfilled) is ultimately intended for digital game studies minors, for the purposes of enhancing studies, and providing accessible methods of video game emulation that fits a variety of skills, physical abilities and hardware. However, the proposal itself is intended for the UO administration. Digital game studies (should it become a minor) will benefit greatly from being able to study games that are older and harder to get their hands on. I plan on reaching this audience by my administration project proposal, and which would make a substantive change to the program. 
- 
### dependencies and resources
*What resources do you need to reach your goals? Consider equipment, technologies, programs, web hosting, data storage, expertise, and time. Where will you get the resources you need? Identify specific entities, offices, subscriptions, spaces, etc. available through UO or the community.*

- As I haven’t finalized my specific programs for video game emulation, this is all subject to change. However, I plan to suggest software and hardware that currently exists in the market, and will not be doing any coding myself. I am using criteria listed above to evaluate and choose emulators for research purposes. For example, one emulator I plan to use is OpenEMU, an open-source emulator on Mac. Besides these, I plan on potentially speaking to specific University of Oregon professors for background/prevalence/context of emulators in my proposal, such as Maxwell Foxman and Amanda Cote.
