## pitch
- My research topic is: video game emulation
- My research question is: how can the university of oregon develop a method for accessible video game emulation, and why is it important?
- I expect to work with the following *materials*: legal cases, scholarly articles about video game preservation, popular media with expertise into emulation, video game datasets, video game ROM's and emulators, interviews with experts such as UO faculty 
- I plan to *process* these materials by: summarize and citing important parts, as well as transcribing or recording interviews, compiling a detailed bibliography
- I plan to *present* these materials by: project outline and emulation guide written in markdown on github, written plans for physical and digital emulation emulation, and a written history of emulation and why it's important. 
- My final submission will take this form: a project outline and guide for digital video game emulation + what the uo dream lab is looking for, as well as additional research documenting the history and legality of video game emulation, and why it's important.
- This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities: scholars who want to study video games out of production, university students who want to play/experience these video games, and anyone who is interested. 
- I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project: experience with digital video game emulation, journalistic interview and research background, technical expertise, coding expertise, assocation and connection with people who may help me develop this project
- In order to do this project, I need to learn: the best methods for emulation, the most popular platforms, future-proofing emulation, accessible emulation methods, safety of promotion of freeware that can be associated with piracy, legal precedents for emulation and ROM's,
