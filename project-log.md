## pitch
- __My research topic is:__ video game emulation
- __My research question is:__ how can the university of oregon develop a method for accessible video game emulation, and why is it important?
- __I expect to work with the following *materials*:__ legal cases, scholarly articles about video game preservation, popular media with expertise into emulation, video game datasets, video game ROM's and emulators, interviews with experts such as UO faculty 
- __I plan to *process* these materials by:__ summarize and citing important parts, as well as transcribing or recording interviews, compiling a detailed bibliography
- __I plan to *present* these materials by:__ project outline and emulation guide written in markdown on github, written plans for physical and digital emulation emulation, and a written history of emulation and why it's important. 
- __My final submission will take this form:__ a project outline and guide for digital video game emulation + what the uo dream lab is looking for, as well as additional research documenting the history and legality of video game emulation, and why it's important.
- __This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities:__ scholars who want to study video games out of production, university students who want to play/experience these video games, and anyone who is interested. 
- __I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project:__ experience with digital video game emulation, journalistic interview and research background, technical expertise, coding expertise, assocation and connection with people who may help me develop this project
- __In order to do this project, I need to learn:__ the best methods for emulation, the most popular platforms, future-proofing emulation, accessible emulation methods, safety of promotion of freeware that can be associated with piracy, legal precedents for emulation and ROM's

## bibliography
*The bibliography should include at least seven (7) sources:*
- *at least one primary (literary or archival) source or dataset you are studying or examining;* 
- *at least four peer-reviewed scholarly sources framing and informing your thinking: articles, chapters, or books published by university or academic presses, or excerpts from academic reference sources (note that being deposited in Scholars' Bank does *not* mean a source is peer reviewed.)*
- *the other 2+ sources may be primary, scholarly, popular, journalistic, governmental/policy documents, datasets, etc.*

## notes
- this annotated bibliography is intended for private usage to help keep a specific journal of the usage of each source of research. 

## research question
how can the university of oregon develop a method for accessible video game emulation, and why is it important?
## annotated bibliography
*Each annotation should include:*
- *a full citation in Chicago, MLA, APA, or AP style (or another style appropriate to your discipline, with approval)*
- *a 4-5 sentence annotation summarizing the main ideas and content of the piece and discussing how you plan to use it for your project.*

### source 1 annotation
- citation: Newman, James. “Saving (and Re-Saving) Videogames: Rethinking Emulation for Preservation, Exhibition and Interpretation.” International Journal of Creative Media Research 1.1 (2019): n. pag. Web.
- summary: In this article for The International Journal of Creative Media Research, Newman argues against the “fetishization” of audiovisual accuracy in video game emulation. In its place, Newman focuses on the “transformative nature of emulation” – such as the unique tools that are offered when played through an emulator like the “savestate.” Taking in these new considerations, games can preserved to keep the original state in mind, as well as embracing features which allow for opportunities away from the original game experience. 
- potential use for project: highlighting the importance use of emulation.

### source 2 annotation
- citation: 203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2000) // Karas, Stan. "Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp. ." Berkeley
Technology Law Journal, vol. 16, no. 1, 2001, pp. 33-52. HeinOnline. 

- summary: In this 1999-2000 case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Connectix, Inc., was sued by Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc for the development of a Playstation emulator, “Virtual Game Station.” None of Sony’s computer code was within the emulator, but the process was reverse engineered. In the district decision, the court prohibited the marketing of the VGS and rejected the defense of “fair use.” However, on appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court determined that it did in fact constitute fair use. Disassembly for the purposes of reverse engineering is legal, and Sony’s original code and BIOS program contained too many aspects that could not be considered copyrightable. The code being entirely new was consistent with “transformative in nature” copyright laws. While the Playstation and VGS can play the same games, the VGS is a “wholly new product.”
- potential use for project: emulators are a very complex and legal grey area, and this helps explain why.

### source 3 annotation
- citation: Libby, Jeffrey S. "The Best Games in Life Are Free: Videogame Emulation in a
Copyrighted World." Suffolk University Law Review, vol. 36, no. 3, 2003, pp. 843-862.
HeinOnline. 
- summary: This 2003 article from Suffolk University Law Review by Jeffrey S. Libby sets and tells the history of emulation, and pushes readers towards emulation archiving – especially with the possibility of nothing being left in less than fifty years. Video game EPROMs, batteries, SRAM’s and circuit boards will be physically beyond repair for the original hardware, with the potential for some games to go extinct. This article recaps history, from early computer creation, to Sony v. Connectix. Additionally, current legal implications and ramifications going forward, such as tarnishment actions against the emulation industry, should customers associate poor performance with the original console, and not the emulated software. This also raises questions about ROM’s, which are the encoded games playable on emulators. If the ROM’s are not uploaded from the game itself, it is considered copyright infringement. 
- potential use for project: This article is 20 years old, but still highlights an important problem that has yet to be solved; video game life expectancy. These conversations were happening two decades ago, but nothing substantive has been done to push for legal and accessible preservation.
