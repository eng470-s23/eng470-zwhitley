## pitch
- __My research topic is:__ video game emulation
- __My research question is:__ how can the university of oregon develop a method for accessible video game emulation, and why is it important?
- __I expect to work with the following *materials*:__ legal cases, scholarly articles about video game preservation, popular media with expertise into emulation, video game datasets, video game ROM's and emulators, interviews with experts such as UO faculty 
- __I plan to *process* these materials by:__ summarize and citing important parts, as well as transcribing or recording interviews, compiling a detailed bibliography
- __I plan to *present* these materials by:__ project outline and emulation guide written in markdown on github, written plans for physical and digital emulation emulation, and a written history of emulation and why it's important. 
- __My final submission will take this form:__ a project outline and guide for digital video game emulation + what the uo dream lab is looking for, as well as additional research documenting the history and legality of video game emulation, and why it's important.
- __This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities:__ scholars who want to study video games out of production, university students who want to play/experience these video games, and anyone who is interested. 
- __I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project:__ experience with digital video game emulation, journalistic interview and research background, technical expertise, coding expertise, assocation and connection with people who may help me develop this project
- __In order to do this project, I need to learn:__ the best methods for emulation, the most popular platforms, future-proofing emulation, accessible emulation methods, safety of promotion of freeware that can be associated with piracy, legal precedents for emulation and ROM's

## bibliography
*The bibliography should include at least seven (7) sources:*
- *at least one primary (literary or archival) source or dataset you are studying or examining;* 
- *at least four peer-reviewed scholarly sources framing and informing your thinking: articles, chapters, or books published by university or academic presses, or excerpts from academic reference sources (note that being deposited in Scholars' Bank does *not* mean a source is peer reviewed.)*
- *the other 2+ sources may be primary, scholarly, popular, journalistic, governmental/policy documents, datasets, etc.*
