For this prototype proposal, I followed the guidelines of the NEH Summer Stipends Application. 

## Narrative // Significance and Contribution

My project is about video games. In particular, the methodologies and tools to play them in formats aside from their original devices. This is known as emulation. Oftentimes, when people think of emulators, they think retro games and pirated software. This isn’t entirely wrong, emulators have historically been used as a way to play games acquired through illegal means and older games that have discontinued hardware. But it doesn’t paint the full picture of what emulators are truly capable of. Emulation can function as a tool for accessibility. It can help gamers who may be physically disabled play games previously inaccessible (due to control schemes, older hardware, and many other reasons), provide in-game software to help players who may be struggling, and much more. My project aims to explore the function of emulators as a tool for accessibility, which has a significant gap in research. 

Video games are the most valuable entertainment industry, estimated at nearly $200B, more than both the music and film industry combined (Respectively, $100B and $25B, according to Statista). Despite this, there’s a lack of movement towards preservation and appreciation. Video games aren’t talked about on the same levels, but are receiving more cultural prevalence as time has gone on. Compared to other mediums, video games face the challenge of physical elements. Video games are nearly 50 years old, and have been made with parts that rust, degrade, and disintegrate. The most common issue in older consoles is batteries. Before systems began to have proprietary and independent batteries in the console, cartridges had built in batteries, S-RAM or static random access memory. Preserving games in their original format to play on their original hardware is nearly impossible, as such. To preserve such a game or console, you’d undoubtedly have to turn to aftermarket parts or scavenge, as companies rarely issue replacement parts.

This project originally began from a passion for retro games and wanting to bring them to my school campus, and hoping to help preserve games. To be clear, this project is still about video game emulators for the usage of accessibility. However, this project can be used to complement existing, (although limited) research in video game preservation. Video game emulators present a clear solution: Play the original software on emulated hardware, using the tools built-in to help with accessibility challenges. Video game emulators are the solution to preservation, and the future of accessibility. The problem is: not enough people are talking about it. With my project, I hope to begin research into this topic, and start a conversation that can help both sides. 

In acknowledging this topic, there’s another side of the coin that must be addressed. Emulators have not been beloved by game publishers as much as they have their fans. Multiple court cases have occurred, most notably Sony Computer Entertainment v. Connectix Corporation (203 F.3d 596 (2000)). Unequivocally, emulation has been ruled as fair use – so long as the emulator in question doesn’t contain any of the information contained within the original console. Video games on the other hand, are copyright protected. While owning a video game gives you some control over what you do with the game, most terms of services disallow players to upload games to alternative formats. Terms of services are not incredibly legally binding, which has left a somewhat “legal gray area.” In talking about this more, I hope that my research can delve deeper into the usage of emulators and ROMs (Read Only Memory, ie uploaded video games) for disability services. 


## Organization and methods 

My project will be supported by the UO administration through funding, and access. With funding and access, I hope to write an article, as well as appropriate curriculum materials to teach about video emulation for the digital game studies minor. The article in question would speak more on the use of emulators of accessibility, and the argument for preservation as a complementary research topic. This article would showcase future conducted research through interviews with prominent organizations such as AbleGamers, and helping access video game publishers and developers themselves. Funding this project would allow me to buy any related books in this field, as well as afford travel to relevant seminars, organizations and places of interest. Additionally, funding this project would allow me to focus on this work full-time, and help pay for my living expenses. This article will be available digitally, and hosted on github. This project benefits audiences in the humanities through exposure and filling a cultural research gap.

## Competencies, skills, and access 

For the area of my project, I bring competence and skills with digital tools, emulators, and video games. I come from a background in journalism, providing me with necessary skills for thorough interviews and deep research. My topic lacks scholarly articles and is mostly made up of popular media, and I believe these qualifications will help me. I plan to be researching materials that are under copyright, but no specific material that should directly infringe. If I were to conduct a study, I would be interested in conducting a study in a major city or online, asking gamers for their specific input on emulation, and what they know. I have experience with qualtrics from my undergraduate classes, and believe I can put together a competent study. For research resources, I would talk with UO SOJC professors in media studies, as well as my professor for J494: Strategic Communication.

## Final product and dissemination 

The intended audience of this project is digital game studies minors, as well as other researchers. I want to grow this body of work, and promote research within this field. The results of this project will be disseminated through my article of research, and promoted through social media, and word of mouth. The product will appear in English, and available through github, though local backups will be available should another format be requested, or requests for translation. So far, the current project website is: https://github.com/zwhitley11/vgemulationuo.


## Work plan 

My tentative work plan is separated into 8 weeks; with funding, this project can finish research within 2 months. 

-Week 1: Establish research subjects: What organizations and people do I want to interview? What seminars, and places do I want to visit? What are the small-scale goals I want to accomplish? What questions do I want to ask?
-Week 2: Begin initial communication with research subjects, and begin paying for travel expenses as needed. How do I want to organize my article? What pre-research can be done?
-Week 3: Finish pre-research, and allocation of funds. Travel and interview week, so work will be done by ways of reading and literary analysis. Interview research subjects, and attend relevant seminars.
-Week 4: Start compiling research for analysis. Interviews transcribed, article outline put together. 
-Week 5: Article should be 33% through production.
-Week 6: Article should be 66% through production.
-Week 7: Article should be 100% through production, with time left for analysis, peer review and editing. 
-Week 8: Research is finalized, and off for publication.
